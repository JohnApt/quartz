Every tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) has a great challenge to meet; the TTRPG must facilitate [[Roleplay|roleplaying]] while simultaneously providing a system of rules to emulate a smooth game-like experience.

This system aims to minimally constrain your worldâ€™s lore, mechanics, and magic systems by:

- Having minimal [[Flavor Text]] in the core module.
- Having an easy to use [[Spells]] and [[Action Creation System]].

This system also aims to disambiguate roleplay from game mechanics in a way that allows the two to happen in parallel naturally by:

- Having a [[3.5 Phase System]].
- Having a well defined set of terms listed in the [[Glossary]].
- Having a meaningful [[Projects/RPG System/SRD/General/Resources]] management system.
